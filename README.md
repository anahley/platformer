# Oblivion!

Oblivion is a simple platforming game where the player (a mysterious guy with a scarf and no arms) has to walk across unknown urban areas and jump on platforms to reach the end.

First, there is a menu screen where you can tap the option to play.
When you hit play, it will transitition you to the scene where you will be playing.
Tap on the bottom-left corner of the screen to use the joystick to move.
Move to the right to continue onwards.
Once you reach an elevator, you will transition to a new area where the real platforming begins.
If you fall, then you have to restart.
If you make it to the end, then you finish the game and it brings you back to the main menu.

This is a game made by Emir and I, students at the EPHS, during our IOS Development course.
